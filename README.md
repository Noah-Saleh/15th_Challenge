# 15th_Challenge

## Summary of Purpose  

I created a chat-bot that gives retirement advice.
To do this, I used 2 services from AWS (Amazon Web Services): Lambda & Amazon Lex. 

If you didn't know, Amazon's "Alexa" runs on Amazon Lex software; the Lambda service can be used to help specify certain actions for Amazon Lex.
